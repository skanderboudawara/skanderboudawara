- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @skanderboudawara
A data enthusiast, self-taught and passionate about data subjects: I look forward to helping you make data-based decisions through KPI analysis and insights to achieve your project objectives. I was formerly a quality engineer working with many KPIs and dashboards after graduating. Then, I decided at the end of 2021 to go on a career pivot to become a full-time data analyst and then a data engineer. Data was a field I had adored since high school and my goal today is to master most aspects of it.

My top skills are:
â€¢ Recently certified from the Google Data Analyst program 
â€¢ Mastering Python (Pyspark, Pandas), SQL and Skywise
â€¢ Dashboards and KPI analysis (Qlik, Tableau, DataStudio ..)
â€¢ Teamwork, self-taught and reliable

I have also managed and produced Arabic videos to simplify the scientific aspects for an audience of more than 200k on YouTube. âœ¨ Khormologia âœ¨
